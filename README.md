# Wrestling-Rivalries

This was an assignment for one of my classes.

Prompt:
Suppose there are two types of professional wrestlers: “Babyfaces” (good guys) and “Heels” (bad guys). 
Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry. 
Suppose we have a list of n wrestlers and a list of r pairs of rivalries. 
Create an efficient algorithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers 
as Babyfaces and the remainder as Heels such that each rivalry is between a Babyface and a Heel. 
If it is possible to perform such a designation, the algorithm should produce it.

Input: 
*Input is read in from a file specified in the command line at run time. 
The file contains the number of wrestlers, n, followed by their names, 
the number of rivalries r and rivalries listed in pairs.

Output: 
Results are outputted to the terminal.
-- Yes, if possible, followed by a list of the Babyfaces and another list of the Heels.
-- No, if impossible.
